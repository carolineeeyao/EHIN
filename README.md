The overall system is an environmental IoT node that harvests energy from the environment to transmit sensor data to the user. The design can be organized into four subsystems: energy harvesting, sensors, data transmission composed of a transmitter and receiver, and user interface (see Figure 1). The energy harvesting subsystem gathers, regulates, and supplies power to the sensor subsystem and transmitter. The sensor subsystem measures environmental data every second and communicates this information to the transmitter. The transmitter processes the data and sends it to the receiver, which provides it to the user interface subsystem. The measured data will finally be displayed on a website, where relevant components will be updated accordingly.
